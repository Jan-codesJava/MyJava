                boolean --> false
                String --> null

        /* Break & Continue

        inside of loop when you have continue statement --> it behaves a s skip

        inside of a loop when you have break statement --> it stops the execution of the loop

        when you have nested loop , you can have labels for the loops and you can refer to any loop you want to by using the label

        *condition for the IF statement will be checked only ONCE. But condition for the FOR  LOOP will be checked after each iteration

        /*

        double[] studentIds = new double[3];

        ------------------------------------
        Another way of creating array:
        int[] zipCodes = {123, 321, 456}; size of array --> 3 which  is same as length

        zipCodes.length --> 3
         */
